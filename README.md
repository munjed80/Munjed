# Hello, I'm Munjed

I build system-level software that connects data, logic, and real-world workflows.  
My work focuses on automation platforms, operational dashboards, and connected software systems.

---

### What I Build
- Modular systems that combine automation, business logic, and user interaction.
- Dashboards for monitoring, controlling, and coordinating complex processes.
- Toolkits and internal frameworks that reduce repetitive operational work.
- Practical, reliable solutions that avoid hype and unnecessary complexity.

---

### Current Focus
- Designing lightweight, privacy-first automation systems.
- Exploring connected dashboards for operational and field workflows.
- Refining tools aimed at small and medium-sized operators with real constraints.

---

### Featured Projects
- **mhm-uba-main** — Core system concept for automating and coordinating business workflows.
- **mhmit.nl** — Frontend portal for monitoring, tooling, and operational insights.
- **recipebank** — Experimental platform exploring structured data workflows and AI-assisted interaction.

---

### Principles
- **Privacy-first** — Data ownership stays with the user.
- **Lightweight** — Minimal dependencies, clear architecture.
- **Practical** — Built for real environments, not demos.
